Save each generated character to a user-visible list
The character would have a name and on hover would display their stats
The character would have a small 'x' on them to remove them from the list
Clicking Roll Initiative would roll initiative for each character in the list and order them greatest to least top to bottom
The character's would have current health and mana values edittable by the user
Match the style of the exit button and Entropy Engine banner to the other UI 
Scaling in windowed mode never takes away functionality from the edges going off-screen
Add "Physical Damage" and "Magical Damage" buttons to the characters where the user can input a number and it will subtract that character's resistance from it and then subtract that number from their current health
