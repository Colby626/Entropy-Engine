1. Add your new class name under Assets/Scripts/GenerateStats.cs in the enum Class
2. Add your new class in the Dictionary classWeights in the same script with its weights
	This is the Google Sheet I used to calculate weights: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ot3yGjghJdC6G9v0UOX8EPgTcdkwQWsX4zbnGdPo6mA/edit?usp=sharing
	Green cells are inputs, blue cells are outputs
	"Parts" of a class mean how much weight you give that class in generating a new class
		1 part warrior, 0 parts every other class is the warrior class
		1 part warrior, 1 part archer is half warrior, half archer
		3 part mage, 3 part archer, 1 part warrior is mostly a magic archer, with some warrior class mixed in
