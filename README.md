# Entropy Engine 
This project was built for a custom Tabletop RPG called Lordship.
It can generate characters, roll initiative, roll damage, and keep notes.
As such, it is meant to help those running Lordship to quickly
create fleshed out characters and run combat.

Each item contains {Enchanted} {Rarity} {Item Type}
- Not all items can be enchanted 
- Rarity determines the material the item is made out of or how valuable it is.
- There are a variety of different item types including weapons and armor.

Additionally, there is a coin generator for different categories of loot
- 1 Electrum = 100 Platinum
- 1 Platinum = 100 Gold
- 1 Gold = 100 Silver
- 1 Silver = 100 Copper

Based on the amount of loot found (coinpurse, stash, lockbox, safe, treasury, or horde), a different range of coins will be generated.
If the coins can be broken down into a smaller number of more valuable coins, a button will appear that will do that for you. 

Treasure can also be generated, subtracting from the amount of coins generated
Many aspects of the treasure can be edited from the options menu
